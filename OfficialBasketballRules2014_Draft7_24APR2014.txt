verbally during the game provided they remain within their team bench area. The 
assistant coach shall not address the officials. 

7.6 If there is an assistant coach his name must be entered on the scoresheet before 
the beginning of the game (his signature is not necessary). He shall assume all 
duties and powers of the coach if, for any reason, the coach is unable to continue. 

7.7 When the captain leaves the playing court the coach shall inform an official of the 
number of the player who will act as captain on the playing court. 

7.8 The captain shall act as coach if there is no coach, or if the coach is unable to 
continue and there is no assistant coach entered on the scoresheet (or the latter is 
unable to continue). If the captain must leave the playing court, he may continue to

as coach because of injury, his substitute as captain may replace him as coach. 

7.9 The coach shall designate the free-throw shooter of his team in all cases where the 
free-throw shooter is not determined by the rules.

of playing time, any eventual free throw(s) shall be administered after the end of 
playing time. 

8.9 If an extra period is required as a result of this free throw(s) then all fouls that are 
committed after the end of playing time shall be considered to have occurred during 
an interval of play and the free throws shall be administered before the beginning of 
the extra period. 

Art. 9 Beginning and end of a period or the game 

9.1 The first period begins when the ball leaves the hand(s) of the referee on the toss 
for the jump ball. 

9.2 All other periods begin when the ball is at the disposal of the player taking the 
throw-in. 

9.3 The game cannot begin if one of the teams is not on the playing court with 5 players 
ready to play. 

9.4 For all games, the first team named in the programme (home team) shall have the

• The ball is in flight on a shot for a field goal and: 
▬ An official blows his whistle. 
▬ The game clock signal sounds for the end of the period.

• A player commits a foul on any opponent while the ball is in the control of the 
opponent in the act of shooting for a field goal and who finishes his shot with a 
continuous motion which started before the foul occurred. 


This provision does not apply and the goal shall not count if 

▬ after an official blows his whistle and an entirely new act of shooting is 
made. 
▬ during the continuous motion of a player in the act of shooting the game 
clock signal sounds for an end of period or the shot clock signal sounds. 





Art. 11 Location of a player and an official 

11.1 The location of a player is determined by where he is touching the floor. 

While he is airborne, he retains the same status he had when he last touched the 
floor. This includes the boundary line, the centre line, the 3-point line, the free-throw 
line, the lines delimiting the restricted area and the lines delimiting the no-charge 
semi-circle area. 

11.2 The location of an official is determined in the same manner as that of a player. 
When the ball touches an official, it is the same as touching the floor at the official's 
location. 

Art. 12 Jump ball and alternating possession

roughness. 

12.2 Jump ball procedure 

12.2.1 Each jumper shall stand with both feet inside the half of the centre circle nearest to 
his own basket with one foot close to the centre line. 

12.2.2 Team-mates may not occupy adjacent positions around the circle if an opponent 
wishes to occupy one of those positions. 

12.2.3 The official shall then toss the ball vertically upwards between the 2 opponents, 
higher than either of them can reach by jumping. 

12.2.4 The ball must be tapped with the hand(s) of at least one of the jumpers after it 
reaches its highest point. 

12.2.5 Neither jumper shall leave his position until the ball has been legally tapped. 

12.2.6 Neither jumper may catch the ball or tap it more than twice until it has touched one 
of the non-jumpers or the floor. 

12.2.7 If the ball is not tapped by at least one of the jumpers, the jump ball shall be 
repeated. 

12.2.8 No part of a non-jumper's body may be on or over the circle line (cylinder) before 
the ball has been tapped. 

An infraction of Art. 12.2.1, 12.2.4, 12.2.5, 12.2.6, and 12.2.8 is a violation. 

12.3 Jump ball situations 

A jump ball situation occurs when: 

• A held ball is called. 
• The ball goes out-of-bounds and the officials are in doubt or disagree about 
which of the opponents last touched the ball. 
• A double free-throw violation occurs during an unsuccessful last or only free 
throw. 



• A live ball lodges between the ring and the backboard (except between free 
throws). 
• The ball becomes dead when neither team has control of the ball nor is entitled 
to the ball. 
• After the cancellation of equal penalties against both teams, if there are no 
other foul penalties remaining for administration and neither team had control 
of the ball nor was entitled to the ball before the first foul or violation. 
• All periods other than the first period are to begin. 


12.4 Alternating possession definition 

12.4.1 Alternating possession is a method of causing the ball to become live with a throw-
in rather than a jump ball. 

12.4.2 Alternating possession throw-in: 

• Begins when the ball is at the disposal of the player taking the throw-in. 
• Ends when: 
▬ The ball touches or is legally touched by a player on the playing court. 
▬ The team taking the throw-in commits a violation. 
▬ A live ball lodges between the ring and the backboard during a throw-in. 





12.5 Alternating possession procedure 

12.5.1 In all jump ball situations teams will alternate possession of the ball for a throw-in at 
the place nearest to where the jump ball situation occurs. 

12.5.2 The team that does not gain control of the live ball on the playing court after the 
jump ball will be entitled to the first alternating possession. 

12.5.3 The team entitled to the next alternating possession at the end of any period shall 
start the next period with a throw-in at the centre line extended, opposite the 
scorer’s table, unless there are further free throws and a possession penalty to be 
administered. 

12.5.4 The team entitled to the alternating possession throw-in shall be indicated by the 
alternating possession arrow in the direction of the opponents’ basket. The direction 
of the alternating possession arrow will be reversed immediately when the alterna-
ting possession throw-in ends. 

12.5.5 A violation by a team during its alternating possession throw-in causes that team to 
lose the alternating possession throw-in. The direction of the alternating possession 
arrow will be reversed immediately, indicating that the opponents of the violating 
team will be entitled to the alternating possession throw-in at the next jump ball 
situation. The game shall then be resumed by awarding the ball to the opponents of 
the violating team for a throw-in at the place of the original throw-in. 

12.5.6 A foul by either team: 

• Before the beginning of a period other than the first period, or 
• During the alternating possession throw-in, 


does not cause the team entitled to the throw-in to lose that alternating possession. 

Art. 13 How the ball is played 

13.1 Definition 


During the game, the ball is played with the hand(s) only and may be passed, 
thrown, tapped, rolled or dribbled in any direction, subject to the restrictions of 
these rules. 

13.2 Rule 

A player shall not run with the ball, deliberately kick or block it with any part of the 
leg or strike it with the fist. 

However, to accidentally come into contact with or touch the ball with any part of 
the leg is not a violation. 

An infraction of Art. 13.2 is a violation. 

Art. 14 Control of the ball 

14.1 Definition 

14.1.1 Team control starts when a player of that team is in control of a live ball by holding 
or dribbling it or has a live ball at his disposal. 

14.1.2 Team control continues when: 

• A player of that team is in control of a live ball. 
• The ball is being passed between team-mates. 


14.1.3 Team control ends when: 

• An opponent gains control. 
• The ball becomes dead. 
• The ball has left the player's hand(s) on a shot for a field goal or for a free 
throw. 


Art. 15 Player in the act of shooting 

15.1 Definition 

15.1.1 A shot for a field goal or a free throw is when the ball is held in a player’s hand(s) 
and is then thrown into the air towards the opponents' basket. 

A tap is when the ball is directed with the hand(s) towards the opponents' basket. 

A dunk is when the ball is forced downwards into the opponents' basket with one or 
both hands. 

A tap and a dunk are also considered as shots for a field goal. 

15.1.2 The act of shooting: 

• Begins when the player starts the continuous movement normally preceding 
the release of the ball and, in the judgement of an official, he has started an 
attempt to score by throwing, tapping or dunking the ball towards the 
opponents' basket. 
• Ends when the ball has left the player’s hand(s) and, in the case of an airborne 
shooter, both feet have returned to the floor. 


The player attempting to score might have his arm(s) held by an opponent, thus 
preventing him from scoring, even though he is considered to have made an attempt 
to score. In this case it is not essential that the ball leaves the player's hand(s). 


There is no relationship between the number of legal steps taken and the act of 
shooting. 

15.1.3 A continuous movement in the act of shooting: 

• Begins when the ball has come to rest in the player's hand(s) and the shooting 
motion, usually upward, has started. 
• May include the player's arm(s) and/or body movement in his attempt to shoot 
for a field goal. 
• Ends when the ball has left the player’s hand(s), or if an entirely new act of 
shooting is made. 


Art. 16 Goal: When made and its value 

16.1 Definition 

16.1.1 A goal is made when a live ball enters the basket from above and remains within or 
passes through the basket. 

16.1.2 The ball is considered to be within the basket when the slightest part of the ball is 
within and below the level of the ring. 

16.2 Rule 

16.2.1 A goal is credited to the team attacking the opponents’ basket into which the ball 
has entered as follows: 

• A goal released from a free throw counts 1 point. 
• A goal released from the 2-point field goal area counts 2 points. 
• A goal released from the 3-point field goal area counts 3 points. 
• After the ball has touched the ring on a last or only free throw and is legally 
touched by an offensive or defensive player before it enters the basket, the goal 
counts 2 points. 


16.2.2 If a player accidentally scores a field goal in his team’s basket, the goal counts 2 
points and shall be recorded as having been scored by the captain of the opposing 
team on the playing court. 

16.2.3 If a player deliberately scores a field goal in his team’s basket, it is a violation and 
the goal does not count. 

16.2.4 If a player causes the entire ball to pass through the basket from below, it is a 
violation. 

16.2.5 The game clock must indicate 0:00.3 (3 tenths of a second) or more for a player to 
gain control of the ball on a throw-in or on a rebound after the last or only free throw 
in order to attempt a shot for a field goal. If the game clock indicates 0:00.2 or 0:00.1 
the only type of a valid field goal made is by tapping or directly dunking the ball. 

Art. 17 Throw-in 

17.1 Definition 

17.1.1 A throw-in occurs when the ball is passed into the playing court by the out-of-
bounds player taking the throw-in. 


17.2 Procedure 

17.2.1 An official must hand or place the ball at the disposal of the player taking the throw-
in. He may also toss or bounce pass the ball provided that: 

• The official is no more than 4 m from the player taking the throw-in. 
• The player taking the throw-in is at the correct place as designated by the 
official. 


17.2.2 The player shall take the throw-in at the place nearest to the infraction or where the 
game was stopped by the official, except directly behind the backboard. 

17.2.3 In the following situations the subsequent throw-in shall be administered at the 
centre line extended, opposite the scorer's table: 

• At the beginning of all periods other than the first period. 
• Following a free throw(s) resulting from a technical, unsportsmanlike or disqua-
lifying foul. 


The player taking the throw-in shall have one foot on either side of the centre line 
extended, opposite the scorer’s table, and shall be entitled to pass the ball to a 
team-mate at any place on the playing court. 

17.2.4 When the game clock shows 2:00 minutes or less in the fourth period and in each 
extra period, following a time-out taken by the team that is entitled to possession of 
the ball from its backcourt, the subsequent throw-in shall be administered at the 
throw-in line opposite the scorer’s table in the team’s frontcourt. 

17.2.5 Following a personal foul committed by a player of the team in control of a live ball, 
or of the team entitled to the ball, the subsequent throw-in shall be administered at 
the place nearest to the infraction. 

17.2.6 Whenever the ball enters the basket, but the field goal or the free throw is not valid, 
the subsequent throw-in shall be administered at the free-throw line extended. 

17.2.7 Following a successful field goal or a successful last or only free throw: 

• Any player of the non-scoring team shall take the throw-in at any place behind 
that team’s endline. This is also applicable after an official hands or places the 
ball at the disposal of the player taking the throw-in after a time-out or after any 
interruption of the game following a successful field goal or a successful last or 
only free throw. 
• The player taking the throw-in may move laterally and/or backwards and the 
ball may be passed between team-mates behind the endline, but the 5 second 
count starts when the ball is at the disposal of the first player out-of-bounds. 


17.3 Rule 

17.3.1 The player taking the throw-in shall not: 

• Take more than 5 seconds to release the ball. 
• Step into the playing court while having the ball in his hand(s). 
• Cause the ball to touch out-of-bounds, after it has been released on the throw-
in. 
• Touch the ball on the playing court before it has touched another player. 



• Cause the ball to enter the basket directly. 
• Move from the designated throw-in place behind the boundary line laterally in 
one or both directions, exceeding a total distance of 1 m before releasing the 
ball. He is, however, permitted to move directly backwards from the boundary 
line as far as circumstances allow. 


17.3.2 During the throw-in other player(s) shall not: 

• Have any part of their bodies over the boundary line before the ball has been 
thrown-in across the boundary line. 
• Be closer than 1 m to the player taking the throw-in when the throw-in place 
has less than 2 m distance between the boundary line and any out-of-bounds 
obstructions. 


An infraction of Art. 17.3 is a violation.

The ball is awarded to the opponents for a throw-in at the place of the original 
throw-in.

time-out is granted following a field goal scored by the opponents and without an 
infraction having been called. 

18.2.8 A time-out shall not be permitted to the scoring team when the game clock shows 
2:00 minutes or less in the fourth period and in each extra period and, following a 
successful field goal unless an official has interrupted the game. 


18.3 Procedure 

18.3.1 Only a coach or assistant coach has the right to request a time-out. He shall 
establish visual contact with the scorer or he shall go to the scorer’s table and ask

18.3.5 During the time-out and during an interval of play before the beginning of the 
second, fourth or each extra period the players may leave the playing court and sit 
on the team bench and the team bench personnel may enter the playing court 
provided they remain within the vicinity of their team bench area. 

18.3.6 If the request for the time-out is made by either team after the ball is at the disposal 
of the free-throw shooter for the first or only free throw, the time-out shall be 
granted if: 

• The last or only free throw is successful. 
• The last or only free throw is followed by a throw-in at the centre line extended, 
opposite the scorer’s table. 
• A foul is called between free throws. In this case the free throw(s) will be 
completed and the time-out will be permitted before the new foul penalty is 
administered. 
• A foul is called before the ball becomes live after the last or only free throw. In 
this case the time-out will be permitted before the new foul penalty is 
administered. 
• A violation is called before the ball becomes live after the last or only free 
throw. In this case the time-out will be permitted before the throw-in is 
administered. 


In the event of consecutive sets of free throws and/or possession of the ball 
resulting from more than 1 foul penalty, each set is to be treated separately. 

Art. 19 Substitution 

19.1 Definition

19.3 Procedure 

19.3.1 Only a substitute has the right to request a substitution. He (not the coach or the 
assistant coach) shall go to the scorer’s table and ask clearly for a substitution, 
making the proper conventional sign with his hands, or sit on the substitution chair. 
He must be ready to play immediately. 

19.3.2 A substitution request may be cancelled only before the scorer's signal has

19.3.6 Substitutions shall be completed as quickly as possible. A player who has commit-
ted his 5 fouls or has been disqualified must be substituted immediately (within 
approximately 30 seconds). If, in the judgement of an official, there is a delay of the 
game, a time-out shall be charged against the offending team. If the team has no 
time-out remaining a technical foul for delaying the game may be charged against 
the coach, recorded as 'B'. 

19.3.7 If a substitution is requested during a time-out or during an interval of play other 
than the half-time interval, the substitute must report to the scorer before entering 
the game. 

19.3.8 If the free-throw shooter must be substituted because he: 

• Is injured. 
• Has committed his 5 fouls. 



• Has been disqualified. 


The free throw(s) must be attempted by his substitute who may not be substituted 
again until he has played in the next clock-running phase of the game. 

19.3.9 If the request for a substitution is made by either team after the ball is at the

shall be granted if: 

• The last or only free throw is successful. 
• The last or only free throw is followed by a throw-in at the centre line extended, 
opposite the scorer’s table. 
• A foul is called between free throws. In this case the free throw(s) will be

administered. 
• A foul is called before the ball becomes live after the last or only free throw. In 
this case the substitution will be permitted before the new foul penalty is 
administered. 
• A violation is called before the ball becomes live after the last or only free

ball situation occurs. 

Art. 24 Dribbling 

24.1 Definition 

24.1.1 A dribble is the movement of a live ball caused by a player in control of that ball who 
throws, taps, rolls the ball on the floor or deliberately throws it against the back-
board. 

24.1.2 A dribble starts when a player, having gained control of a live ball on the playing 
court, throws, taps, rolls, dribbles it on the floor or deliberately throws it against the 
backboard and touches it again before it touches another player. 

A dribble ends when the player touches the ball with both hands simultaneously or 
permits the ball to come to rest in one or both hands. 

During a dribble the ball may be thrown into the air provided the ball touches the 
floor or another player before the player who threw it touches it again with his hand. 

There is no limit to the number of steps a player may take when the ball is not in 
contact with his hand. 

24.1.3 A player who accidentally loses and then regains control of a live ball on the playing

between the 2 dribbles he has lost control of a live ball on the playing court because 
of: 

• A shot for a field goal. 
• A touch of the ball by an opponent. 
• A pass or fumble that has touched or been touched by another player. 


Art. 25 Travelling 

25.1 Definition 

25.1.1 Travelling is the illegal movement of one foot or both feet beyond the limits outlined 
in this article, in any direction, while holding a live ball on the playing court. 

25.1.2 A pivot is the legal movement in which a player who is holding a live ball on the 
playing court steps once or more than once in any direction with the same foot, 
while the other foot, called the pivot foot, is kept at its point of contact with the floor. 

25.2 Rule 

25.2.1 Establishing a pivot foot by a player who catches a live ball on the playing 
court: 

• While standing with both feet on the floor: 
▬ The moment one foot is lifted, the other foot becomes the pivot foot. 



• While moving: 
▬ If one foot is touching the floor, that foot becomes the pivot foot. 
▬ If both feet are off the floor and the player lands on both feet simultaneous-
ly, the moment one foot is lifted, the other foot becomes the pivot foot. 
▬ If both feet are off the floor and the player lands on one foot, then that foot 
becomes the pivot foot. If a player jumps off that foot and comes to a stop 
landing on both feet simultaneously, then neither foot is a pivot foot. 





25.2.2 Progressing with the ball by a player who has established a pivot foot while 
having control of a live ball on the playing court: 

• While standing with both feet on the floor: 
▬ To start a dribble, the pivot foot may not be lifted before the ball is released 
from the hand(s). 
▬ To pass or shoot for a field goal, the player may jump off a pivot foot, but 
neither foot may be returned to the floor before the ball is released from the 
hand(s). 






• While moving: 
▬ To pass or shoot for a field goal, the player may jump off a pivot foot and 
land on one foot or both feet simultaneously. After that, one foot or both 
feet may be lifted from the floor but neither foot may be returned to the 
floor before the ball is released from the hand(s). 
▬ To start a dribble, the pivot foot may not be lifted before the ball is released 
from the hand(s). 



• While coming to a stop when neither foot is the pivot foot: 
▬ To start a dribble, neither foot may be lifted before the ball is released from 
the hand(s). 
▬ To pass or shoot for a field goal, one foot or both feet may be lifted but may 
not be returned to the floor before the ball is released from the hand(s). 





25.2.3 A player falling, lying or sitting on the floor: 

• It is legal when a player falls and slides on the floor while holding the ball or, 
while lying or sitting on the floor, gains control of the ball. 
• It is a violation if the player then rolls or attempts to stand up while holding the 
ball. 


Art. 26 3 seconds

the game clock is running. 

26.1.2 Allowances must be made for a player who: 

• Makes an attempt to leave the restricted area. 
• Is in the restricted area when he or his team-mate is in the act of shooting and 
the ball is leaving or has just left the player's hand(s) on the shot for a field goal.

for less than 3 consecutive seconds. 


26.1.3 To establish himself outside the restricted area, the player must place both feet on 
the floor outside the restricted area. 

Art. 27 Closely guarded player 

27.1 Definition 

A player who is holding a live ball on the playing court is closely guarded when an 
opponent is in an active legal guarding position at a distance of no more than 1 m. 

27.2 Rule 

A closely guarded player must pass, shoot or dribble the ball within 5 seconds. 

Art. 28 8 seconds 

28.1 Rule 

28.1.1 Whenever: 

• A player in the backcourt gains control of a live ball, 
• On a throw-in, the ball touches or is legally touched by any player in the back-
court and the team of that player taking the throw-in remains in control of the 
ball in its backcourt, 


that team must cause the ball to go into its frontcourt within 8 seconds. 


28.1.2 The team has caused the ball to go into its frontcourt whenever: 

• The ball, not in control of any player, touches the frontcourt, 
• The ball touches or is legally touched by an offensive player who has both feet 
completely in contact with his frontcourt, 
• The ball touches or is legally touched by a defensive player who has part of his 
body in contact with his backcourt, 
• The ball touches an official who has part of his body in contact with the 
frontcourt of the team in control of the ball. 
• During a dribble from the backcourt to the frontcourt, the ball and both feet of 
the dribbler are completely in contact with the frontcourt. 


28.1.3 The 8 second period will continue with any time remaining when the same team that 
previously had control of the ball is awarded a throw-in in the backcourt, as a result 
of: 

• A ball having gone out-of-bounds. 
• A player of the same team having been injured. 
• A jump ball situation. 
• A double foul. 
• A cancellation of equal penalties against both teams. 


Art. 29 24 seconds 

29.1 Rule 

29.1.1 Whenever: 

• A player gains control of a live ball on the playing court, 
• On a throw-in, the ball touches or is legally touched by any player on the 
playing court and the team of that player taking the throw-in remains in control 
of the ball, 


that team must attempt a shot for a field goal within 24 seconds. 

To constitute a shot for a field goal within 24 seconds: 

• The ball must leave the player's hand(s) before the shot clock signal sounds, 
and 
• After the ball has left the player's hand(s), the ball must touch the ring or enter 
the basket. 


29.1.2 When a shot for a field goal is attempted near the end of the 24-second period 
and the shot clock signal sounds while the ball is in the air: 

• If the ball enters the basket, no violation has occurred, the signal shall be 
disregarded and the goal shall count. 
• If the ball touches the ring but does not enter the basket, no violation has 
occurred, the signal shall be disregarded and the game shall continue. 
• If the ball misses the ring, a violation has occurred. However, if the opponents 
have gained immediate and clear control of the ball, the signal shall be 
disregarded and the game shall continue. 


All restrictions related to goaltending and interference shall apply. 


29.2 Procedure 

29.2.1 If the game is stopped by an official: 

• For a foul or violation (not for the ball having gone out-of-bounds) by the team 
not in control of the ball, 
• For any valid reason by the team not in control of the ball, 
• For any valid reason not connected with either team, 


possession of the ball shall be awarded to the same team that previously had 
control of the ball. 

If a throw-in is awarded to the same team that previously had control of the ball in 
the backcourt, the shot clock shall be reset to 24 seconds. 

If such throw-in is administered in the frontcourt, the shot clock shall be reset as 
follows: 

• If 14 seconds or more is displayed on the shot clock at the time when the game 
was stopped, the shot clock shall not be reset, but shall continue from the time 
it was stopped. 
• If 13 seconds or less is displayed on the shot clock at the time when the game 
was stopped, the shot clock shall be reset to 14 seconds. 


However, if the game is stopped by an official for any valid reason not connected 
with either team and, in the judgement of an official, the reset of the shot clock 
would place the opponents at a disadvantage, the shot clock shall continue from the 
time it was stopped. 

29.2.2 After the ball has touched the ring on an unsuccessful shot for a field goal, a last or 
only free throw, or on a pass, the shot clock shall be reset to 14 seconds, if the team 
which regains control of the ball is the same team that was in control of the ball 
before the ball touched the ring. 

29.2.3 If the shot clock signal sounds in error while a team has control of the ball or 
neither team has control of the ball, the signal shall be disregarded and the game 
shall continue. 

However, if in the judgement of an official, the team in control of the ball has been 
placed at a disadvantage, the game shall be stopped, the shot clock shall be 
corrected and possession of the ball shall be awarded to that team. 

Art. 30 Ball returned to the backcourt 

30.1 Definition 

30.1.1 A team is in control of a live ball in their frontcourt if 

• a player of that team is touching his frontcourt with both feet while holding, 
catching or dribbling the ball in his frontcourt, or 
• the ball is passed between the players of that team in their frontcourt. 


30.1.2 A team in control of a live ball in the frontcourt has caused the ball to be illegally 
returned to their backcourt if a player of that team is the last to touch the ball in his 
frontcourt and the ball is then first touched by a player of that team 

• who has part of his body in contact with the backcourt or 
• after the ball has touched the backcourt of that team. 


This restriction applies to all situations in a team's frontcourt, including throw-ins. 
However, it does not apply to a player who jumps from his frontcourt, establishes 


new team control while still airborne and then lands with the ball in his team’s 
backcourt. 

30.2 Rule 

A team which is in control of a live ball in their frontcourt may not cause the ball to 
be illegally returned to their backcourt. 

30.3 Penalty 

The ball shall be awarded to the opponents for a throw-in in their frontcourt at the 
place nearest to the infraction except directly behind the backboard. 

Art. 31 Goaltending and Interference 

31.1 Definition 

31.1.1 A shot for a field goal or a free throw: 

• Begins when the ball leaves the hand(s) of a player in the act of shooting. 
• Ends when the ball: 
▬ Enters the basket directly from above and remains within or passes 
through the basket. 
▬ No longer has the possibility of entering the basket. 
▬ Touches the ring. 
▬ Touches the floor. 
▬ Becomes dead. 





31.2 Rule 

31.2.1 Goaltending occurs during a shot for a field goal when a player touches the ball 
while it is completely above the level of the ring and: 

• It is on its downward flight to the basket, or 
• After it has touched the backboard. 


31.2.2 Goaltending occurs during a shot for a free throw when a player touches the ball 
while it is in flight to the basket and before it touches the ring. 

31.2.3 The goaltending restrictions apply until: 

• The ball no longer has the possibility of entering the basket. 
• The ball has touched the ring. 


31.2.4 Interference occurs when: 

• After a shot for a field goal or the last or only free throw a player touches the 
basket or the backboard while the ball is in contact with the ring. 
• After a free throw followed by an additional free throw(s), a player touches the 
ball, the basket or the backboard while there is still a possibility that the ball will 
enter the basket. 
• A player reaches through the basket from below and touches the ball. 
• A defensive player touches the ball or the basket while the ball is within the 
basket, thus preventing the ball from passing through the basket. 
• A player causes the basket to vibrate or grasps the basket in such a way that, in 
the judgement of an official, the ball has been prevented from entering the 
basket or has been caused to enter the basket. 
• A player grasps the basket to play the ball. 


31.2.5 When 

• An official blows the whistle while the ball is in the hands of a player in the act 
of shooting, or the ball is in flight on a shot for a field goal, 



• The game clock signal sounds for the end of the period while the ball is in flight 
on a shot for a field goal, 


No player shall touch the ball after it has touched the ring while it still has the 
possibility of entering the basket. 

All restrictions related to goaltending and interference shall apply. 

31.3 Penalty 

31.3.1 If the violation is committed by an offensive player, no points can be awarded. The 
ball shall be awarded to the opponents for a throw-in at the free-throw line 
extended, unless otherwise stated in the rules. 

31.3.2 If the violation is committed by a defensive player, the offensive team is awarded: 

• 1 point, if the ball was released for a free throw. 
• 2 points, if the ball was released from the 2-point field goal area. 
• 3 points, if the ball was released from the 3-point field goal area. 


The awarding of the points is considered as if the ball had entered the basket. 

31.3.3 If the goaltending is committed by a defensive player during a last or only free 
throw, 1 point shall be awarded to the offensive team, followed by a technical foul 
penalty charged against the defensive player.

RULE SIX - FOULS 

Art. 32 Fouls 

32.1 Definition 

32.1.1 A foul is an infraction of the rules concerning illegal personal contact with an 
opponent and/or unsportsmanlike behaviour. 

32.1.2 Any number of fouls may be called against a team. Irrespective of the penalty, each 
foul shall be charged, entered on the scoresheet against the offender and penalised 
accordingly. 

Art. 33 Contact: General principles 

33.1 Cylinder principle 

The cylinder principle is defined as the space within an imaginary cylinder occupied 
by a player on the floor. It includes the space above the player and is limited to: 

• The front by the palms of the hands, 
• The rear by the buttocks, and 
• The sides by the outer edge of the arms and legs. 


The hands and arms may be extended in front of the torso no further than the 
position of the feet, with the arms bent at the elbows so that the forearms and hands 
are raised. The distance between his feet will vary according to his height. 

 



Diagram 5 Cylinder principle 

33.2 Principle of verticality 

During the game, each player has the right to occupy any position (cylinder) on the 
playing court not already occupied by an opponent. 

This principle protects the space on the floor which he occupies and the space 
above him when he jumps vertically within that space. 


As soon as the player leaves his vertical position (cylinder) and body contact occurs 
with an opponent who had already established his own vertical position (cylinder), 
the player who left his vertical position (cylinder) is responsible for the contact. 

The defensive player must not be penalised for leaving the floor vertically (within his 
cylinder) or having his hands and arms extended above him within his own cylinder. 

The offensive player, whether on the floor or airborne, shall not cause contact with 
the defensive player in a legal guarding position by: 

• Using his arms to create more space for himself (pushing off). 
• Spreading his legs or arms to cause contact during or immediately after a shot 
for a field goal. 


33.3 Legal guarding position 

A defensive player has established an initial legal guarding position when: 

• He is facing his opponent, and 
• He has both feet on the floor. 


The legal guarding position extends vertically above him (cylinder) from the floor to 
the ceiling. He may raise his arms and hands above his head or jump vertically but 
he must maintain them in a vertical position inside the imaginary cylinder. 

33.4 Guarding a player who controls the ball 

When guarding a player who controls (holding or dribbling) the ball, the elements of 
time and distance do not apply. 

The player with the ball must expect to be guarded and must be prepared to stop or 
change his direction whenever an opponent takes an initial legal guarding position 
in front of him, even if this is done within a fraction of a second. 

The guarding (defensive) player must establish an initial legal guarding position 
without causing contact before taking his position. 

Once the defensive player has established an initial legal guarding position, he may 
move to guard his opponent, but he may not extend his arms, shoulders, hips or legs 
to prevent the dribbler from passing by him. 

When judging a charge/block situation involving a player with the ball, an official 
shall use the following principles: 

• The defensive player must establish an initial legal guarding position by facing 
the player with the ball and having both feet on the floor. 
• The defensive player may remain stationary, jump vertically, move laterally or 
backwards in order to maintain the initial legal guarding position. 
• When moving to maintain the initial legal guarding position, one foot or both 
feet may be off the floor for an instant, as long as the movement is lateral or 
backwards, but not towards the player with the ball. 
• Contact must occur on the torso, in which case the defensive player would be 
considered as having been at the place of contact first. 
• Having established a legal guarding position the defensive player may turn 
within his cylinder to avoid injury. 


In any of the above situations, the contact shall be considered as having been 
caused by the player with the ball. 


33.5 Guarding a player who does not control the ball 

A player who does not control the ball is entitled to move freely on the playing court 
and take any position not already occupied by another player. 

When guarding a player who does not control the ball, the elements of time and 
distance shall apply. A defensive player cannot take a position so near and/or so 
quickly in the path of a moving opponent that the latter does not have sufficient time 
or distance either to stop or change his direction. 

The distance is directly proportional to the speed of the opponent, but never less 
than 1 normal step. 

If a defensive player does not respect the elements of time and distance in taking 
his initial legal guarding position and contact with an opponent occurs, he is 
responsible for the contact. 

Once a defensive player has established an initial legal guarding position, he may 
move to guard his opponent. He may not prevent him from passing by extending his 
arms, shoulders, hips or legs in his path. He may turn within his cylinder to avoid 
injury. 

33.6 A player who is in the air 

A player who has jumped into the air from a place on the playing court has the right 
to land again at the same place. 

He has the right to land on another place on the playing court provided that the 
landing place and the direct path between the take-off and landing place is not 
already occupied by an opponent(s) at the time of take-off. 

If a player has taken off and landed but his momentum causes him to contact an 
opponent who has taken a legal guarding position beyond the landing place, the 
jumper is responsible for the contact. 

An opponent may not move into the path of a player after that player has jumped 
into the air. 

Moving under a player who is in the air and causing contact is usually an unsports-
manlike foul and in certain circumstances may be a disqualifying foul. 

33.7 Screening: Legal and illegal 

Screening is an attempt to delay or prevent an opponent without the ball from 
reaching a desired position on the playing court. 

Legal screening is when the player who is screening an opponent: 

• Was stationary (inside his cylinder) when contact occurs. 
• Had both feet on the floor when contact occurs. 


Illegal screening is when the player who is screening an opponent: 

• Was moving when contact occurred. 
• Did not give sufficient distance in setting a screen outside the field of vision of a 
stationary opponent when contact occurred. 
• Did not respect the elements of time and distance of an opponent in motion 
when contact occurred. 



If the screen is set within the field of vision of a stationary opponent (front or 
lateral), the screener may establish the screen as close to him as he desires, 
provided there is no contact. 

If the screen is set outside the field of vision of a stationary opponent, the screener 
must permit the opponent to take 1 normal step towards the screen without making 
contact. 

If the opponent is in motion, the elements of time and distance shall apply. The 
screener must leave enough space so that the player who is being screened is able 
to avoid the screen by stopping or changing direction. 

The distance required is never less than 1 and never more than 2 normal steps. 

A player who is legally screened is responsible for any contact with the player who 
has set the screen. 

33.8 Charging 

Charging is illegal personal contact, with or without the ball, by pushing or moving 
into an opponent’s torso. 

33.9 Blocking 

Blocking is illegal personal contact which impedes the progress of an opponent 
with or without the ball. 

A player who is attempting to screen is committing a blocking foul if contact occurs 
when he is moving and his opponent is stationary or retreating from him. 

If a player disregards the ball, faces an opponent and shifts his position as the 
opponent shifts, he is primarily responsible for any contact that occurs, unless other 
factors are involved. 

The expression 'unless other factors are involved' refers to deliberate pushing, 
charging or holding of the player who is being screened. 

It is legal for a player to extend his arm(s) or elbow(s) outside of his cylinder in 
taking position on the floor but they must be moved inside his cylinder when an 
opponent attempts to pass by. If the arm(s) or elbow(s) are outside his cylinder and 
contact occurs, it is blocking or holding. 

33.10 No-charge semi-circle areas 

The no-charge semi-circle areas are drawn on the playing court for the purpose of 
designating a specific area for the interpretation of charge/block situations under 
the basket. 

On any penetration play into the no-charge semi-circle area any contact caused by 
an airborne offensive player with a defensive player inside the no-charge semi-
circle shall not be called as an offensive foul, unless the offensive player is illegally 
using his hands, arms, legs or body. This rule applies when 

• the offensive player is in control of the ball whilst airborne, and 
• he attempts a shot for a field goal or passes off the ball, and 
• the defensive player has one foot or both feet in contact with the no-charge 
semi-circle area. 



33.11 Contacting an opponent with the hand(s) and/or arm(s) 

The touching of an opponent with a hand(s) is, in itself, not necessarily a foul. 

The officials shall decide whether the player who caused the contact has gained an 
advantage. If contact caused by a player in any way restricts the freedom of 
movement of an opponent, such contact is a foul. 

Illegal use of the hand(s) or extended arm(s) occurs when the defensive player is in 
a guarding position and his hand(s) or arm(s) is placed upon and remains in contact 
with an opponent with or without the ball, to impede his progress. 

To repeatedly touch or 'jab' an opponent with or without the ball is a foul, as it may 
lead to rough play. 

It is a foul by an offensive player with the ball to: 

• 'Hook' or wrap an arm or an elbow around a defensive player in order to obtain 
an advantage. 
• 'Push off' to prevent the defensive player from playing or attempting to play the 
ball, or to create more space for himself. 
• Use an extended forearm or hand, while dribbling, to prevent an opponent from 
gaining control of the ball. 


It is a foul by an offensive player without the ball to 'push off' to: 

• Get free to receive the ball. 
• Prevent the defensive player from playing or attempting to play the ball. 
• Create more space for himself. 


33.12 Post play 

The principle of verticality (cylinder principle) applies also to post play. 

The offensive player in the post position and the defensive player guarding him must 
respect each other's rights to a vertical position (cylinder). 

It is a foul by an offensive or defensive player in the post position to shoulder or hip 
his opponent out of position or to interfere with his opponent's freedom of 
movement using extended arms, shoulders, hips, legs or other parts of the body. 

33.13 Illegal guarding from the rear 

Illegal guarding from the rear is personal contact with an opponent, by a defensive 
player, from behind. The fact that the defensive player is attempting to play the ball 
does not justify his contact with an opponent from the rear. 

33.14 Holding 

Holding is illegal personal contact with an opponent that interferes with his freedom 
of movement. This contact (holding) can occur with any part of the body. 

33.15 Pushing 

Pushing is illegal personal contact with any part of the body where a player forcibly 
moves or attempts to move an opponent with or without the ball. 


Art. 34 Personal foul 

34.1 Definition 

34.1.1 A personal foul is a player’s illegal contact with an opponent, whether the ball is live 
or dead. 

A player shall not hold, block, push, charge, trip or impede the progress of an oppo-
nent by extending his hand, arm, elbow, shoulder, hip, leg, knee or foot, nor by ben-
ding his body into an 'abnormal' position (outside his cylinder), nor shall he indulge 
in any rough or violent play. 

34.2 Penalty 

A personal foul shall be charged against the offender. 

34.2.1 If the foul is committed on a player not in the act of shooting: 

• The game shall be resumed with a throw-in by the non-offending team at the 
place nearest to the infraction. 
• If the offending team is in the team foul penalty situation, then Art. 41 will apply. 


34.2.2 If the foul is committed on a player in the act of shooting, that player shall be 
awarded a number of free throws as follows: 

• If the shot released from the field goal area is successful, the goal shall count 
and, in addition, 1 free throw. 
• If the shot released from the 2-point field goal area is unsuccessful, 2 free 
throws. 
• If the shot released from the 3-point field goal area is unsuccessful, 3 free 
throws. 
• If the player is fouled as, or just before, the game clock signal sounds for the 
end of the period or as, or just before, the shot clock signal sounds, while the 
ball is still in the player's hand(s) and the field goal is successful, the goal shall 
not count and 2 or 3 free throws will be awarded. 


Art. 35 Double foul 

35.1 Definition 

35.1.1 A double foul is a situation in which 2 opponents commit personal fouls against 
each other at approximately the same time. 

35.2 Penalty 

A personal foul shall be charged against each offender. No free throws shall be 
awarded and the game shall be resumed as follows: 

If at approximately the same time as the double foul 

• A valid field goal, or a last or only free throw is scored, the ball shall be awar-
ded to the non-scoring team for a throw-in at any place at the endline. 
• A team had control of the ball or was entitled to the ball, the ball shall be 
awarded to this team for a throw-in at the place nearest to the infraction. 
• Neither team had control of the ball nor was entitled to the ball, a jump ball 
situation occurs. 



Art. 36 Technical foul 

36.1 Rules of conduct 

36.1.1 The proper conduct of the game demands the full and loyal cooperation of the 
players and team bench personnel with the officials, table officials and commissio-
ner, if present. 

36.1.2 Each team shall do its best to secure victory, but this must be done in the spirit of 
sportsmanship and fair play. 

36.1.3 Any deliberate or repeated non-cooperation or non-compliance with the spirit and 
intent of this rule shall be considered as a technical foul. 

36.1.4 The official may prevent technical fouls by giving warnings or even overlooking 
minor infractions which are obviously unintentional and have no direct effect upon 
the game, unless there is repetition of the same infraction after the warning. 

36.1.5 If an infraction is recognised after the ball becomes live, the game shall be stopped 
and a technical foul charged. The penalty shall be administered as if the technical 
foul had occurred at the time it is charged. Whatever occurred during the interval 
between the infraction and the game being stopped shall remain valid. 

36.2 Violence 

36.2.1 Acts of violence may occur during the game, contrary to the spirit of sportsmanship 
and fair play. These should be stopped immediately by the officials and, if neces-
sary, by public order enforcement officers. 

36.2.2 Whenever acts of violence occur involving players or team bench personnel on the 
playing court or in its vicinity, the officials shall take the necessary action to stop 
them. 

36.2.3 Any of the above persons who are guilty of flagrant acts of aggression against 
opponents or officials shall be disqualified. The referee must report the incident to 
the organising body of the competition. 

36.2.4 Public order enforcement officers may enter the playing court only if requested to 
do so by the officials. However, should spectators enter the playing court with the 
obvious intention of committing acts of violence, the public order enforcement 
officers must intervene immediately to protect the teams and officials. 

36.2.5 All other areas, including entrances, exits, hallways, dressing rooms, etc., come 
under the jurisdiction of the organising body of the competition and the public order 
enforcement officers. 

36.2.6 Physical actions by players or team bench personnel which could lead to damaging 
of game equipment must not be permitted by the officials. 

When behaviour of this nature is observed by the officials, the coach of the 
offending team shall be given a warning. 

Should the action(s) be repeated, a technical foul shall immediately be called on the 
individual(s) involved. 


36.3 Definition

not limited to: 

• Disregarding warnings given by officials. 
• Disrespectfully touching the officials, the commissioner, the table officials or 
the team bench personnel. 
• Disrespectfully communicating with the officials, the commissioner, the table 
officials or the opponents. 
• Using language or gestures likely to offend or incite the spectators. 
• Baiting an opponent or obstructing his vision by waving his hands near his

• Excessive swinging of elbows. 
• Delaying the game by deliberately touching the ball after it passes through the 
basket or by preventing a throw-in from being taken promptly. 
• Falling down to fake a foul. 
• Hanging on the ring in such a way that the weight of the player is supported by 
the ring, unless a player grasps the ring momentarily following a dunk shot or, in 
the judgement of an official, is trying to prevent injury to himself or to another 
player. 
• Goaltending during the last or only free throw by a defensive player. The 
offensive team shall be awarded 1 point, followed by the technical foul penalty 
charged against the defensive player. 


36.3.2 A technical foul by team bench personnel is a foul for disrespectfully communica-
ting with or touching the officials, the commissioner, the table officials or the 
opponents, or an infraction of a procedural or an administrative nature.

2 technical fouls. 

36.3.4 A coach shall be disqualified for the remainder of the game when: 

• He is charged with 2 technical fouls ('C') as a result of his personal 
unsportsmanlike behaviour. 
• He is charged with 3 technical fouls, either all of them ('B') or one of them ('C'), 
as a result of the unsportsmanlike behaviour of other team bench personnel. 


36.3.5 If a player or a coach is disqualified under Art. 36.3.3 or Art. 36.3.4, that technical 
foul shall be the only foul to be penalised and no additional penalty for the 
disqualification shall be administered. 

36.4 Penalty

Art. 37 Unsportsmanlike foul 

37.1 Definition 

37.1.1 An unsportsmanlike foul is a player contact foul which, in the judgement of an 
official is: 

• Not a legitimate attempt to directly play the ball within the spirit and intent of 
the rules. 
• Excessive, hard contact caused by a player in an effort to play the ball. 
• Contact by the defensive player from behind or laterally on an opponent in an 
attempt to stop the fast break and there is no defensive player between the 
offensive player and the opponent’s basket. 
• Contact by the defensive player on an opponent on the court during the last 2 
minutes in the fourth period and in each extra period, when the ball is out-of-
bounds for a throw-in and still in the hands of the official or at the disposal of 
the player taking the throw-in. 


37.1.2 The official must interpret the unsportsmanlike fouls consistently throughout the 
game and to judge only the action. 

37.2 Penalty 

37.2.1 An unsportsmanlike foul shall be charged against the offender. 

37.2.2 Free throw(s) shall be awarded to the player who was fouled, followed by: 

• A throw-in at the centre line extended, opposite the scorer’s table.

50.6 Switched off, after the ball becomes dead and the game clock has been stopped in 
any period when there is a new control of the ball for either team and there are 
fewer than 14 seconds on the game clock. 

The shot clock signal does not stop the game clock or the game, nor causes the ball 
to become dead, unless a team is in a control of the ball.

B.10 The running score 

B.10.1 The scorer shall keep a chronological running summary of the 
points scored by each team. 

B.10.2 There are 4 columns on the scoresheet for running score. 

B.10.3 Each column is divided again into 4 columns. The 2 on the left 
are for team 'A' and the 2 on the right for team 'B'. The centre 
columns are for the running score (160 points) for each team. 

The scorer shall: 

• First, draw a diagonal line (/) for any valid field goal scored 
and a filled circle () for any valid free throw scored, over 
the new total number of points as accumulated by the team 
that has just scored. 
• Then, in the blank space on the same side of the new total 
number of points (beside the new / or ), enter the number 
of the player who scored the field goal or the free throw. 


B.11 The running score: Additional instructions 

B.11.1 A 3-point field goal scored by a player shall be recorded by 
drawing a circle around the player's number. 

B.11.2 A field goal accidentally scored by a player in his own basket 
shall be recorded as having been scored by the captain of the 
opposing team on the playing court. 

B.11.3 Points scored when the ball does not enter the basket (Art. 31) 
shall be recorded as having been scored by the player who 
attempted the shot. 

B.11.4 At the end of each period, the scorer shall draw a thick circle 
() around the latest number of points scored by each team, 
followed by a thick horizontal line under those points and under 
the number of each player who scored those last points. 

B.11.5 At the beginning of each period the scorer shall continue to keep 
a chronological running summary of the points scored from the 
point of interruption. 

B.11.6 Whenever possible, the scorer should check his running score 
with the visual scoreboard. If there is a discrepancy, and his 
score is correct, he shall immediately take steps to have the 
scoreboard corrected. If in doubt or if one of the teams raises an 
objection to the correction, he shall inform the referee as soon 
as the ball becomes dead and the game clock is stopped.

B.12 The running score: Summing up 

B.12.1 At the end of each period, the scorer shall enter the score of 
that period in the proper section in the lower part of the 
scoresheet. 

B.12.2 At the end of the game, the scorer shall draw 2 thick horizontal 
lines under the final number of points scored by each team and 
the numbers of the players who scored those last points. He 
shall also draw a diagonal line to the bottom of the column in 
order to obliterate the remaining numbers (running score) for 
each team. 

B.12.3 At the end of the game, the scorer shall enter the final score 
and the name of the winning team. 

B.12.4 The scorer shall then enter his surname, in block capital letters, 
on the scoresheet, after this has been done by the assistant 
scorer, timer and the shot clock operator. 

B.12.5 Once signed by the umpire(s), the referee shall be the last to 
approve and sign the scoresheet. This act terminates the 
officials’ administration and connection with the game. 

 

Diagram 12 
Summing up 



Note: Should one of the captains (CAP) sign the scoresheet under protest (using 
the space marked 'Captain's signature in case of protest'), the table officials 
and the umpire(s) shall remain at the disposal of the referee until he gives 
them the permission to leave.

C - PROTEST PROCEDURE 

If, during a FIBA official competition, a team believes its interests have been adversely 
affected by a decision of an official [referee or umpire(s)] or by any event that took place 
during a game, it must proceed in the following manner: 

C.1 The captain (CAP) of that team shall, immediately at the end of the game, inform the 
referee that his team is protesting against the result of the game and sign the 
scoresheet in the space marked 'Captain's signature in case of protest'. 

To make this protest valid, it is necessary for the official representative of the 
national federation or the club to give confirmation of this protest in writing. This 
must be made within 20 minutes following the end of the game. 

Detailed explanations are not necessary. It is sufficient to write: 'The national 
federation (or club) X protests against the result of the game between the teams X 
and Y'. Then he shall deposit with the FIBA representative or with the President of 
the Technical Committee, a sum equivalent to CHF 1,500, as security. 

The national federation of the team or the club in question must submit to the FIBA 
representative or to the President of the Technical Committee the text of its protest 
within 1 hour following the end of the game. 

If the decision of the Technical Committee is in favour of the protesting team, the 
deposit will be refunded. 

C.2 The referee shall, within 1 hour following the end of the game, report the incident 
which leads to the protest, to the FIBA representative or to the President of the 
Technical Committee. 

C.3 Should the national federation of the team or the club in question, or that of the 
opposing team or club, not be in agreement with the decision of the Technical 
Committee, it may then address an appeal to the Jury of Appeal. 

To make this appeal valid, it must be made, in writing, within 20 minutes following 
the delivery of the decision of the Technical Committee and be accompanied by a 
deposit equivalent to CHF 3,000, as security. 

If the decision of the Jury of Appeal is in favour of the appealing team, the deposit 
will be refunded. 

C.4 Videos, films, pictures or any equipment, visual, electronic, digital, or otherwise, 
may be used to determine responsibility in matters of discipline or for educational 
(training) purposes only after the game has ended. 


D - CLASSIFICATION OF TEAMS 

D.1 Procedure 

D.1.1 Teams shall be classified according to their win-loss record, namely 2 points for 
each game won, 1 point for each game lost (including lost by default) and 0 points 
for a game lost by forfeit. 

D.1.2 The procedure is to be applied for each team having played only 1 game against 
each opponent in the group (single tournament) as well as for each team having 
played 2 or more games against each opponent (league with home and away games 
or more tournaments). 

D.1.3 If 2 or more teams have the same win-loss record of all games in the group, the 
game(s) between these 2 or more teams shall decide on the classification. If the 2 or 
more teams have the same win-loss record of the games between them, further 
criteria will be applied in the following order: 

• Higher goal difference of the games between them 

• Higher number of goals scored in the games between them 

• Higher goal difference of all games in the group 

• Higher number of goals scored in all games in the group 

If these criteria still cannot decide, a draw shall decide on the classification. 

D.1.4 If at any level of these criteria one or more team(s) can be classified, the procedure 
of D.1.3 shall be repeated from the beginning for all the remaining teams not 
classified yet. 

D.2 Examples 

D.2.1 Example 1 

A vs. B 100 – 55 B vs. C 100 – 95

D.3 Additional procedure 

D.3.1 Art. D.1 and D.2 are valid after all the teams have played all their games in the group. 

D.3.2 If all teams did not play all their games yet and if 2 or more teams have the same 
win-loss record the higher goal difference of all games of these teams played so far 
shall decide on the classification. 

D.4 Forfeit 

D.4.1 A team which, without valid reason, fails to show up for a scheduled game or 
withdraws from the playing court before the end of the game, shall lose the game by 
forfeit and receive zero (0) points in the classification. 

D.4.2 If the team forfeits for the second time, the results of all games played by this team 
shall be nullified. 


E - MEDIA TIME-OUTS 

E.1 Definition 

The organising body of the competition may decide for itself whether Media time-
outs shall be applied and, if so, of what duration (60, 75, 90 or 100 seconds). 

E.2 Rule 

E.2.1 In each period 1 Media time-out is permitted, in addition to the regular time-outs. 
Media time-outs in extra periods are not permitted. 

E.2.2 The first time-out in each period (team or Media) shall be 60, 75, 90 or 100 seconds in 
duration. 

E.2.3 The duration of all other time-outs in a period shall be 60 seconds. 

E.2.4 Both teams shall be entitled to 2 time-outs during the first half and 3 time-outs 
during the second half. 

These time-outs may be requested at any time during the game and their duration 
may be: 

• If considered to be a Media time-out 60, 75, 90 or 100 seconds, i.e. the first in a 
period, or 
• If not considered to be a Media time-out 60 seconds, i.e. requested by either 
team, after the Media time-out has been granted. 


E.3 Procedure 

E.3.1 Ideally, the Media time-out should be taken with 5 minutes remaining in the period. 
However, there is no guarantee that this will be the case. 

E.3.2 If neither team has requested a time-out before the last 5 minutes remaining in the 
period then a Media time-out shall be granted at the first opportunity when the ball 
becomes dead and the game clock is stopped. This time-out will not be charged 
against either team. 

E.3.3 If either team is granted a time-out before the last 5 minutes remaining in the period, 
that time-out shall be used as a Media time-out. 

This time-out shall count as both a Media time-out and a time-out for the team 
requesting it. 

E.3.4 According to this procedure, there would be a minimum of 1 time-out in each period 
and a maximum of 6 time-outs in the first half and a maximum of 8 time-outs in the 
second half.
